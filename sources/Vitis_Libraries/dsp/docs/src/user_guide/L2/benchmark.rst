.. _BENCHMARK:

=============
Benchmark/QoR
=============

This section provides the L2 performance benchmarks and QoR (Quality of Results) for AIE DSP library elements with various configurations. The results are extracted from hardware emulation based simulations using the Makefile flow defined in: :ref:`COMPILING_AND_SIMULATING`.
The device used for benchmarking (xcvc1902-vsva2197-1LP-e-S-es1) uses a 1GHz clock for the AIE array. Some devices and speedgrades available clock the array at other frequencies (e.g. 1.25GHz for the xcvc1902-vsva2197-2MP-e-S ). Since the library elements measured here are contained entirely within the AIE array hence subject to one clock alone, it is fair to scale throughput figures seen here by the ratio of clock speeds to get the throughput figures for devices where the AIE array is clocked at a different frequency.

The QoR are reflected using the below metrics:

- cycleCountAvg         - average cycle count that takes to execute kernel function (not including kernel/window buffer overheads).
- throughputAvg         - input throughput calculated based on `cycleCountAvg`, taking into account input window size (not including kernel/window buffer overheads).
- initiationInterval    - time that must pass between two consecutive iterations execution starts of a given function, including overheads i.e., time between a function start and itsÂ previous start.
- throughputInitIntAvg  - input throughput calculated based on `initiationInterval`, taking into account input window size.
- NUM_BANKS             - number of memory banks used by the design
- NUM_AIE               - number of AIE tiles used by the design
- DATA_MEMORY           - total data memory in Bytes used by the design
- PROGRAM_MEMORY        - program memory in Bytes used by each kernel

In addition, for multi-kernel designs, each kernel may take a different amount of time to execute and as a result, figures reported for each kernel's `cycleCountAvg`, `throughputAvg` may vary slightly.

To give a good comparison figure, the highest value of `cycleCountAvg` reported by each kernel in a multi-kernel configuration  will be presented as `cycleCountAvg` in the benchmark tables. Similarly, the lowest value of `throughputAvg`reported by each kernel will be presented as `throughputAvg`.

Furthermore, PROGRAM_MEMORY metrics are harvested for each kernel the design consists of. For example a FIR configured to be implemented on two tiles (CASC_LEN=2) will have two sets of figures displayed in the table below (space deliminated).
