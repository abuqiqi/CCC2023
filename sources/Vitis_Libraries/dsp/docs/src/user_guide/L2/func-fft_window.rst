.. _FFT_Window:

==========
FFT Window
==========

This library element implements an FFT window function such as a Hamming Window. It has configurable point size, data type, scaling (as a shift), static/dynamic point size, window size, interface api (stream/window) and parallelism factor.
Table :ref:`FFT_Window_HEADER_FORMAT` lists the template parameters used to configure the top level graph of the fft_window_graph class.

~~~~~~~~~~~
Entry Point
~~~~~~~~~~~

The graph entry point is the following:

.. code-block::

    xf::dsp::aie::fft::fft_window_graph

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Supported Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The data type to the FFT window is controlled by the template parameter TT_DATA. This may take one of 3 choices: cint16, cint32 or cfloat. This selection applies to both input data and output data.
The template parameter TT_COEFF may take one of three values, int16, int32 or cfloat, but currently this value is forced by the choice of TT_DATA, so TT_COEFF must be set to int16 for TT_DATA = cint16 or int32 for TT_DATA=cint32 or float for TT_DATA=cfloat.

To see details on the ports for the FFT Window, see :ref:`API_REFERENCE`. Note that the number and type of ports are determined by the configuration of template parameters.

~~~~~~~~~~~~
Design Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The FFT Window performs a sample by sample scaling of data prior to entry to an FFT. Since there is an open-ended list of window types in the literature, this unit takes the raw coefficient values as a constructor argument rather than a choice of window types from a finite supported library. For convenience, utility functions are provided for some of the common window types, i.e. Hamming, Hann, Blackman and Kaiser. On construction, the array containing the window coefficients must be passed to the graph constructor.

Dynamic Point Size
------------------

The FFT Window supports dynamic (run-time controlled) point sizes. This feature is available when the template parameter TP_DYN_PT_SIZE is set to 1. When set to 0 (static point size) all data will be expected in frames of TP_POINT_SIZE data samples, though multiple frames may be input together using TP_WINDOW_VSIZE which is an integer multiple of TP_POINT_SIZE. When set to 1 (dynamic point size) each _window_ must be preceeded by a 256bit header to describe the run-time parameters of that window. Note that TP_WINDOW_VSIZE described the number of samples in a window so does not include this header. The format of the header is described in Table 5. When TP_DYN_PT_SIZE = 1 TP_POINT_SIZE describes the maximum point size which may be input.

   +-------------------------------+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The locations are set to suit TT_DATA type. That is, for TT_DATA=cint16, direction is described in the first cint16 (real part) of the 256 bit header and point size is described in the real part of the second cint16 value.
Similarly, for TT_DATA=cint32, the real part of the first cint32 value in the header holds the direction field and the second cint32 valueâ€™s real part holds the Point size (radix2) field.

Note that for TT_DATA=cfloat, the values in the header are expected as cfloat and are value-cast (not reinterpret-cast) to integers internally. The output window also has a header. This is copied from the input header except for the status field, which is inserted. The status field is ignored on input. If an illegal point size is entered, the output header will have this field set to a non-zero value and the remainder of the output window is undefined.

For dynamic operation (TP_DYN_PT_SIZE = 1), the window will operate on frames of TP_POINT_SIZE or TP_POINT_SIZE/2^N down to 16. Since the window values cannot be faithfully determined by sampling or interpolating from the provided parent array, it is necessary when in this mode to provide an array holding the window values for each point size. Since this is full array is TP_POINT_SIZE*(1+ 1/2 + 1/4 + ...) the overall table size provided must be TP_POINT_SIZE * 2. For example, for TP_POINT_SIZE=64, the values of the window coefficients for point size 64 will occupy array indices 0 to 63. The coefficients for point size 32 will occupy indices 64 thru 95, and those for point size 16 will occupy 96 thru 111.

Super Sample Rate Operation
---------------------------

While the term Super Sample Rate strictly means the processing of more than one sample per clock cycle, in the AIE context it is taken to mean an implementation using parallel kernels to improve performance at the expense of additional resource use.
In the FFT window, SSR operation is controlled by the template parameter TP_SSR. This parameter is intended to improve performance and also allow support of point sizes beyond the limitations of a single tile.

The parameter TP_SSR allows a trade of performance for resource use in the form of tiles used. The tile utilization is quite simply the same as the value of TP_SSR.


Super Sample Rate Sample to Port Mapping
////////////////////////////////////////

When Super Sample Rate operation is used, data is input and output using multiple ports. These multiple ports on input or output act as one channel. The mapping of samples to ports is that each successive sample should be passed to a different port in a round-robin fashion, e.g. with TP_SSR set to 4, samples 0, 4, 8, ... should be sent to input port 0, samples 1, 5, 9, ... to input port 1, samples 2, 6, 10, ... to input port 2, sample 3, 7, 11, ... to input port 3 and so on.

Scaling
-------
Scaling in the FFT window is controlled by the TP_SHIFT parameter which describes how many binary places by which to shift the result to the right, i.e. only power-of-2 scaling values are supported. For integer types, it is suggested that the window coefficient values approach the maximum positive value which can be expressed the type selected, to maximize the number of significant digits. e.g. the provided utility functions scale int16 windows to a maximum value of 2^14 and therefore a TP_SHIFT value of 14 will normalize output values and ensure saturation does not occur.

No scaling is applied at any point when the data type is cfloat. Setting TP_SHIFT to any value other than 0 when TT_DATA is cfloat will result in an error.

Saturation
----------
Distortion caused by saturation will be possible for certain configurations of the FFT window. For instance, with integer data types if any window coefficient values exceed 2^TP_SHIFT, saturation will occur. Since the window coefficient values are input at construction time, no compile-time error can be issued for this hazard, so it is for the user to ensure that saturation does not occur.

Constraints
-----------

The FFT window does not contain any constraints. It is a single kernel design except when TP_SSR>1 in which case the port connections force placement of the tiles on separate tiles.
